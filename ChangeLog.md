# ChangeLog

* `github` - if private, then create private repo [thx @CraigCottingham]

## v0.8

* `postgresql` - supported on `eycloud` (Currently PostgreSQL 9.1)
* `eycloud` - can boot clusters, in addition to solos
* `mysql` - always generates `sample.rake`
* bin/scrolls is short-form of bin/appscrolls
* `puma` & `thin` - moved into zzz archive until Puma is released on EY Cloud; or another supporting platform added
* `spork` - moved into zzz archive as part of simplification

### v0.8.1

* `twitter_bootstrap` - includes `rails_basics`
* `eycloud` - only using `ey_cli` (`engineyard` gem has `net-ssh` conflict with `chef` gem)
* Display scrolls that will be used - explicitly requested (green) and implicitly included (yellow)
* `eycloud` - only unicorn and passenger initially supported
* `eycloud` - don't check for available app name - this should be implemented in ey_cli
